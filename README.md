# Epromoter GWAS analysis

# Description
There is growing evidence that a wide range of human diseases and physiological traits are influenced by genetic variation of cis-regulatory elements. We and others have shown that a subset of promoter elements, termed Epromoters, can regulate proximal and distal genes in cis. This opens a paradigm in the study of regulatory variants, as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within Epromoters might influence the expression of several (distal) genes at the same time, which could disentangle the identification of disease-associated genes. Here, we built a comprehensive resource of human Epromoters using newly generated and publicly available high-throughput reporter assays. We showed that Epromoters display intrinsic and epigenetic features that distinguish them from typical promoters. By integrating Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs), and 3D chromatin interactions, we found that regulatory variants at Epromoters are concurrently associated with more diseases and physiological traits, as compared with typical promoters. To dissect the regulatory impact of Epromoter variants, we evaluated their impact on regulatory activity by analyzing allelic-specific high-throughput reporter assays and provided reliable examples of pleiotropic Epromoters. In summary, our study represents a comprehensive resource of regulatory variants supporting the pleiotropic role of Epromoters.
